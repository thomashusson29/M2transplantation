  abstract = {Oxygenated ex situ machine perfusion of donor livers is an alternative for static cold preservation that can be performed at temperatures from 0 °C to 37 °C. Organ metabolism depends on oxygen to produce adenosine triphosphate and temperatures below 37 °C reduce the metabolic rate and oxygen requirements. The transport and delivery of oxygen in machine perfusion are key determinants in preserving organ viability and cellular function. Oxygen delivery is more challenging than carbon dioxide removal, and oxygenation of the perfusion fluid is temperature dependent. The maximal oxygen content of water-based solutions is inversely related to the temperature, while cellular oxygen demand correlates positively with temperature. Machine perfusion above 20 °C will therefore require an oxygen carrier to enable sufficient oxygen delivery to the liver. Human red blood cells are the most physiological oxygen carriers. Alternative artificial oxygen transporters are hemoglobin-based oxygen carriers, perfluorocarbons, and an extracellular oxygen carrier derived from a marine invertebrate. We describe the principles of oxygen transport, delivery, and consumption in machine perfusion for donor livers using different oxygen carrier-based perfusion solutions and we discuss the properties, advantages, and disadvantages of these carriers and their use.},

  abstract = {Long-standing research has shown that increased lipid content in donor livers is associated with inferior graft outcomes posttransplant. The global epidemic that is obesity has increased the prevalence of steatosis in organ donors, to the extent that it has become one of the main reasons for declining livers for transplantation. Consequently, it is one of the major culprits behind the discrepancy between the number of donor livers offered for transplantation and those that go on to be transplanted. Steatotic livers are characterized by poor microcirculation, depleted energy stores because of an impaired capacity for mitochondrial recovery, and a propensity for an exaggerated inflammatory response following reperfusion injury culminating in poorer graft function postoperatively. Ex situ machine perfusion, currently a novel method in graft preservation, is showing great promise in providing a tool for the recovery and reconditioning of marginal livers. Hence, reconditioning these steatotic livers using machine perfusion has the potential to increase the number of liver transplants performed. In this review, we consider the problematic issues associated with fatty livers in the realm of transplantation and discuss pharmacological and nonpharmacological options that are being developed to enhance recovery of these organs using machine perfusion and defatting strategies.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: One of the most promising applications of liver normothermic machine perfusion (NMP) is the potential to directly assess graft viability and injury. In most NMP studies, perfusate transaminases are utilized as markers of graft injury. Our aim was to further elucidate the metabolism of transaminases by healthy porcine livers during NMP, specifically whether such livers could clear circuit perfusate transaminases. METHODS: A highly concentrated transaminase solution was prepared from homogenized liver, with an aspartate aminotransferase (AST) level of 107,427 U/L. Three livers in the treatment group were compared to three controls, during 48 hours of NMP. In the treatment group, the circuit perfusate was injected with the transaminase solution to artificially raise the AST level to a target of 7,500 U/L. Perfusate samples were taken at two-hour intervals and analyzed for biochemistry until NMP end. Graft oxygen consumption and vascular parameters were monitored. RESULTS: Compared to controls, treated perfusions demonstrated abrupt elevations in transaminase levels (p{$>$}0.0001) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) (p{$>$}0.0001), which decreased over time, but never to control baseline. Liver function, as demonstrated by lactate clearance and oxygen consumption was not different between groups. The treatment group demonstrated a higher portal vein resistance (p = 0.0003), however hepatic artery resistance was similar. Treated livers had higher bile production overall (p{$<$}0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: Addition of high levels of transaminases and LDH to a healthy porcine liver during ex situ perfusion results in progressive clearance of these enzymes, suggesting preserved liver metabolism. Such tolerance tests may provide valuable indicators of prospective graft function.},

  abstract = {Background~           In current studies of ex situ liver perfusion there exists considerable variability in perfusate composition, including the type of oxygen carrier. Herein, we aim to clarify the minimal hemoglobin level necessary during normothermic porcine ex situ liver perfusion.           Methods~           Livers procured from 35 to 45 kg domestic pigs were connected to our experimental ex situ circuit (n = 10). In the treatment group, perfusate was sequentially diluted hourly to predetermined hemoglobin levels. At the end of each hemoglobin dilution, perfusate samples were analyzed for liver transaminases, lactate dehydrogenase (LD), total bilirubin, and lactate levels. Liver oxygen consumption was measured. In the control group, livers were perfused continually for a duration of 24 hours at target hemoglobin levels of 30 and 20 g/L.           Results~           Rising liver transaminases, significantly higher lactate (P {$<$} 0.001), and LD levels (P {$<$} 0.001) were noted at lower perfusate hemoglobin levels in the treatment group. Liver oxygen utilization (P {$<$} 0.001) and hepatic artery oxygen delivery (P {$<$} 0.001) were significantly lower at lower hemoglobin levels, whereas liver vessel resistance remained relatively constant. Histology demonstrated increasing parenchymal damage at lower hemoglobin levels. In control livers, higher perfusate transaminases, higher lactate, and LD levels were noted at a perfusion hemoglobin level of 20 g/L.           Conclusions~           Ex situ liver function decompensated during perfusion between a mean hemoglobin level of 30 to 20 g/L, as evidenced by notably rising lactate and LD levels. This study demonstrates optimal hemoglobin concentration during normothermic ex situ liver perfusion to ensure a fully metabolically functioning graft.},

  abstract = {Background Although plasma free hemoglobin (fHb) test is important for assessing intravascular hemolysis, it is still dependent on the gold standard Harboe method using manual and labor-intensive spectrometric measurements at the wavelength of 380-415-450 nm. We established an automated fHb assay using a routine chemistry autoanalyzer that can be tuned to a wavelength of 380-416-450 nm. Methods The linearity, precision, accuracy, correlation, and sample carryover of fHb measurement using TBA200FRneo method and manual Harboe method were evaluated, respectively. fHb values measured by manual Harboe method were compared with those measured by our new automated TBA200FRneo method. Results fHb measurements were linear in the range of 0.05 38.75 µmol/L by TBA200FRneo and 0.05 9.69 µmol/L by manual Harboe method. Imprecision analysis (\%CV) revealed 0.9 2.8\% for TBA200FRneo method and 5.3 13.6\% for the manual Harboe method. Comparison analysis showed 0.9986 of correlation coefficient (TBA200FRneo = 0.970 × Harboe + 0.12). In analytical accuracy analysis, the manual Harboe method revealed about 4 times higher average total error \% (12.2\%) than the TBA200FRneo automated method (2.8\%). The sample carryover was −0.0016\% in TBA200FRneo method and 0.0038\% in Harboe method. Conclusions In the measurement of fHb, the automated TBA200FRneo method showed better performance than the conventional Harboe method. It is expected that the automated fHb assay using the routine chemistry analyzer can replace the gold standard Harboe method which is labor-intensive and need an independent spectrophotometry equipment.},

  abstract = {Normothermic machine perfusion of donor livers has become standard practice in the field of transplantation, allowing the assessment of organs and safe extension of preservation times. Alongside its clinical uses, there has been expanding interest in extended normothermic machine perfusion (eNMP) of livers as a potential vehicle for medical research. Reproducible extended normothermic machine perfusion has remained elusive due to its increased complexity and monitoring requirements. We set out to develop a reproducible protocol for the extended normothermic machine perfusion of whole human livers.},

  abstract = {Ex vivo normothermic machine perfusion has been proposed to protect deceased donor kidneys. However, its benefits remain ambiguous. We postulate that the use of red blood cells (RBCs) and associated secondary hemolysis may in fact cause renal injury, offsetting potential advantages. During 48-hour normothermic perfusion of seven human donor kidneys, we observed progressive hemolysis, leading to iron accumulation in perfusate and~tissue. Untargeted lipidomic profiling revealed significant increases in oxidized phospholipid species in perfused kidneys, pointing towards iron-dependent cell death known as ferroptosis. Next, in twelve additional perfusions, we assessed strategies to mitigate hemolysis-driven injury. Dialysis-based free hemoglobin removal reduced lipid peroxidation, but a ferroptosis gene signature persisted. In contrast, cell-free perfusion at subnormothermia negated iron accumulation, the ferroptosis gene signature, phospholipid peroxidation, and acute kidney injury. Our findings highlight the pathological role of hemolysis and iron on the kidney, urging restraint in the clinical application of RBC-based kidney perfusion.},

We developed the machine in a stepwise fashion using pig livers. Study of multiple ex vivo parameters and early phase reperfusion in vivo demonstrated the viability of pig livers perfused for 1 week without the need for additional blood products or perfusate exchange. We tested the approach on ten injured human livers that had been declined for transplantation by all European centers. After a 7-d perfusion, six of the human livers showed preserved function as indicated by bile production, synthesis of coagulation factors, maintained cellular energy (ATP) and intact liver structure.},

Currently, no consensus exists in methodology and perfusion protocols. Here, the authors performed a systematic literature search to identify human and porcine studies reporting on liver NMP with red blood cells. A qualitative synthesis was performed concerning technical aspects of MP, fluid composition, gas supply, and liver positioning. Thirty-seven publications including 11 human and 26 porcine studies were considered for qualitative synthesis. Control mode, pressure, flow, perfusate additives, and targeted blood gas parameters varied across human as well as porcine studies. For future analyses, it is advisable to report flow adjusted to liver weight and exact pressure parameters including mean, systolic, and diastolic pressure. Parenteral nutrition and insulin addition was common. Parenteral nutrition included amino acids and/or glucose without lipids. Taurocholic acid derivatives were used as bile flow promoters. However, short-term human NMP without taurocholic acid derivatives seems to be possible. This finding is relevant due to the lack of clinical grade bile salts. Near physiological oxygen tension in the perfusate is doable by adjusting gas flows, while blood gas parameters regulation needs more detailed description.},

In this study, 20 primary liver transplantation recipients of older grafts (≥70 years) were randomized 1:1 to NMP or cold storage (CS) groups. The primary study endpoint was to evaluate graft and patient survival at 6 months posttransplantation. The secondary endpoint was to evaluate liver and bile duct biopsies; IRI by means of peak transaminases within 7 days after surgery; and incidence of biliary complications at month 6. Liver and bile duct biopsies were collected at bench surgery, end of ex situ NMP, and end of transplant surgery. Interleukin (IL) 6, IL10, and tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α) perfusate concentrations were tested during NMP. All grafts were successfully transplanted. Median (interquartile range) posttransplant aspartate aminotransferase peak was 709 (371-1575) IU/L for NMP and 574 (377-1162) IU/L for CS (P = 0.597). There was 1 hepatic artery thrombosis in the NMP group and 1 death in the CS group. In NMP, we observed high TNF-α perfusate levels, and these were inversely correlated with lactate (P {$<$} 0.001). Electron microscopy showed decreased mitochondrial volume density and steatosis and an increased volume density of autophagic vacuoles at the end of transplantation in NMP versus CS patients (P {$<$} 0.001). Use of NMP with older liver grafts is associated with histological evidence of reduced IRI, although the clinical benefit remains to be demonstrated.},

  abstract = {Background. Various methods of haemoglobin (Hb) measurement are available to guide transfusion including several methods that allow for measurement at the bedside. This study directly compared their absolute and trend accuracy compared with values from the central lab (reference method). Methods. Adult patients undergoing surgery with expected blood loss wore a rainbow ReSposable sensor connected to a Radical-7 Pulse CO-Oximeter (SpHb). Arterial samples were analysed with a haematology analyser (HbLab), a satellite COOximeter (HbSat), and a point-of-care haemoglobinometer (HemoCue; HcueArt). Concomitantly, ear capillary blood was tested using the same haemoglobinometer (HcueCap). Absolute accuracy and the clinical significance of error were assessed with Bland – Altman plots and three-zone error grids. Trend analysis was performed using a modified polar plot, testing both directionality and magnitude of Hb changes compared with the reference. Results. Two hundred and nineteen measurements from 53 patients with HbLab ranging between 6.8 and 16.3 g dl21 (4.2 and 10.1 mmol litre21) were recorded. Compared with the reference method, bias (precision) was 0.2 (0.2) g dl21 [0.1 (0.1) mmol litre21] for HcueArt, 0.8 (0.3) g dl21 [0.5 (0.2) mmol litre21] for HbSat, 0.5 (0.5) g dl21 [0.3 (0.3) mmol litre21] for HcueCap and 1.0 (1.2) g dl21 [0.6 (0.7) mmol litre21] for SpHb. None of the devices tested would have led to unnecessary or delayed transfusion according to 2006 ASA transfusion criteria. Trend accuracy was better for HcueArt and HbSat than for HcueCap and SpHb. Conclusion. Bedside Hb measurement methods differ in their agreement to a laboratory haematology analyser but none would have led to transfusion errors. Trial Registry Number. RCB 2009-AO1144-53.},

  abstract = {Currently two major types of centrifugal pumps are commercially available for ventricular assist: the Biomedicus-cone (Group I) and the Centrimed-impeller pump (now Sarns 3M) (Group II). To compare them for blood trauma and hemolysis, an in-vitro experiment was designed with a Stöckert roller pump as a standard control (Group III). The in-vitro circuit was constructed consisting of a pump head, electromagnetic flow probe, polyvinyl chloride tubing and a reservoir, identical for all groups. Human ACD blood was used for priming and was circulated with a flow rate of 2 L/min for 24 h. Blood samples were taken at 0, 1, 3, 6, 12, and 24 h and zero control values were subtracted from the resulting data per time interval. Among the 16 parameters studied, a highly significant difference in favor of Group I was found for glutamate oxalacetate transaminase (GOT) and lactate dehydrogenase (p less than 0.0001) and for the free plasma hemoglobin (p less than 0.0001) after 12 and 24 h, respectively. The hemolytic index (Allen) again was lowest for group I in contrast to Groups II and III (0.012 versus 0.060 and 1.70) after 24 h. All other parameters studied did not render significant differences between the systems tested. The authors conclude that the Biomedicus pump currently is the least traumatic centrifugal pump for ventricular assist.},

  abstract = {Introduction. The success of liver transplantation has been limited by the unavailability of suitable donor livers. The current organ preservation technique, i.e., static cold storage (SCS), is not suitable for marginal organs. Alternatively, normothermic machine perfusion (NMP) promises to recreate the physiological environment and hence holds promise for the better organ preservation. The objective of this systematic review is to provide an overview of the safety, benefits, and insight into the other potential useful parameters of NMP in the liver preservation. Material and Methods. We searched the current literature following registration in the International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews (PROSPERO) with registration number CRD42018086034 for prospective trials comparing the role of NMP device to SCS in liver transplant by searching the PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane, BIOSIS, Crossref, and Scopus databases and clinical trial registry. Results. The literature search identified five prospective clinical trials (four being early phase single institutional and single randomized multi-institutional) comparing 187 donor livers on NMP device to 273 donor livers on SCS. The primary outcome of interest was to assess the safety and graft survival at day 30 after transplant following NMP of the donor liver. Secondary outcomes included were early allograft dysfunction (EAD) in the first seven days; serum measures of liver functions as bilirubin, aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine amino transferase (ALT), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), and international normalized ratio (INR) on days 1–7; major complications as defined by a Clavien-Dindo score ≥ 3; and patient and graft survival and biliary complications at six months. The peaked median AST level between days 1 and 7 in the five trials was 417–1252 U/L (range 84–15009 U/L) while on NMP and 839–1474 U/L (range 153–8786 U/L) in SCS group. The median bilirubin level on day 7 ranged within 25–79 µmol/L (range 8–344 µmol/l) and 30–47.53 µmol/l (range 9–340 µmol/l) in NMP and SCS groups, respectively. A single case of PNF was reported in NMP group in the randomized trial while none of the other preliminary studies reported any in either group. There was intertrial variability in EAD which ranged within 15–56\% in NMP group while being within 23–37\% in SCS group. Biliary complications observed in NMP group ranged from 0 to 20\%. Single device malfunction was reported in randomized controlled trial leading to renouncement of transplant while none of the other trials reported any machine failure, although two user related device errors inadvertent were reported. Conclusion. This review outlines that NMP not only demonstrated safety and efficacy but also provided the favourable environment of organ preservation, repair, and viability assessment to donor liver prior to the transplantation with low rate of posttransplantation complication as PNF, EAD, and biliary complication; however further studies are needed to broaden our horizon.},

  abstract = {Background Normothermic machine perfusion of the liver (NMP-L) is a novel technique that preserves liver grafts under near-physiological conditions whilst maintaining their normal metabolic activity. This process requires an adequate oxygen supply, typically delivered by packed red blood cells (RBC). We present the first experience using an acellular hemoglobin-based oxygen carrier (HBOC) Hemopure in a human model of NMP-L. Methods Five discarded high-risk human livers were perfused with HBOC-based perfusion fluid and matched to 5 RBC-perfused livers. Perfusion parameters, oxygen extraction, metabolic activity and histological features were compared during 6 hours of NMP-L. The cytotoxicity of Hemopure was also tested on human hepatic primary cell line cultures using an in vitro model of ischemia reperfusion injury. Results The vascular flow parameters and the perfusate lactate clearance were similar in both groups. The HBOC-perfused livers extracted more oxygen than those perfused with RBCs (O2ER 13.75 vs 9.43 \% x105 per gram of tissue, p=0.001). In vitro exposure to Hemopure did not alter intracellular levels of reactive oxygen species and there was no increase in apoptosis or necrosis observed in any of the tested cell lines. Histological findings were comparable between groups. There was no evidence of histological damage caused by Hemopure. Conclusion Hemopure can be used as an alternative oxygen carrier to packed red cells in NMP-L perfusion fluid.},

  abstract = {Liver transplantation has become an immense success; nevertheless, far more recipients are registered on waiting lists than there are available donor livers for transplantation. High-risk, extended criteria donor livers are increasingly used to reduce the discrepancy between organ demand and supply. Especially for high-risk livers, dynamic preservation using machine perfusion can decrease post-transplantation complications and may increase donor liver utilisation by improving graft quality and enabling viability testing before transplantation. To further increase the availability of donor livers suitable for transplantation, new strategies are required that make it possible to use organs that are initially too damaged to be transplanted. With the current progress in experimental liver transplantation research, (long-term) normothermic machine perfusion may be used in the future as a dynamic platform for regenerative medicine approaches, enabling repair and regeneration of injured donor livers. Currently explored therapeutics such as defatting cocktails, RNA interference, senolytics, and stem cell therapy may assist in the repair and/or regeneration of injured livers before transplantation. This review will provide a forecast of the future utility of normothermic machine perfusion in decreasing the imbalance between donor liver demand and supply by enabling the repair and regeneration of damaged donor livers.},

  abstract = {Ischemic cold storage (ICS) of livers for transplant is associated with serious posttransplant complications and underuse of liver allografts.To determine whether portable normothermic machine perfusion preservation of livers obtained from deceased donors using the Organ Care System (OCS) Liver ameliorates early allograft dysfunction (EAD) and ischemic biliary complications (IBCs).This multicenter randomized clinical trial (International Randomized Trial to Evaluate the Effectiveness of the Portable Organ Care System Liver for Preserving and Assessing Donor Livers for Transplantation) was conducted between November 2016 and October 2019 at 20 US liver transplant programs. The trial compared outcomes for 300 recipients of livers preserved using either OCS (n\,=\,153) or ICS (n\,=\,147). Participants were actively listed for liver transplant on the United Network of Organ Sharing national waiting list.Transplants were performed for recipients randomly assigned to receive donor livers preserved by either conventional ICS or the OCS Liver initiated at the donor hospital.The primary effectiveness end point was incidence of EAD. Secondary end points included OCS Liver ex vivo assessment capability of donor allografts, extent of reperfusion syndrome, incidence of IBC at 6 and 12 months, and overall recipient survival after transplant. The primary safety end point was the number of liver graft–related severe adverse events within 30 days after transplant.Of 293 patients in the per-protocol population, the primary analysis population for effectiveness, 151 were in the OCS Liver group (mean [SD] age, 57.1 [10.3] years; 102 [67\%] men), and 142 were in the ICS group (mean SD age, 58.6 [10.0] years; 100 [68\%] men). The primary effectiveness end point was met by a significant decrease in EAD (27 of 150 [18\%] vs 44 of 141 [31\%]; P\,=\,.01). The OCS Liver preserved livers had significant reduction in histopathologic evidence of ischemia-reperfusion injury after reperfusion (eg, less moderate to severe lobular inflammation: 9 of 150 [6\%] for OCS Liver vs 18 of 141 [13\%] for ICS; P\,=\,.004). The OCS Liver resulted in significantly higher use of livers from donors after cardiac death (28 of 55 [51\%] for the OCS Liver vs 13 of 51 [26\%] for ICS; P\,=\,.007). The OCS Liver was also associated with significant reduction in incidence of IBC 6 months (1.3\% vs 8.5\%; P\,=\,.02) and 12 months (2.6\% vs 9.9\%; P\,=\,.02) after transplant.This multicenter randomized clinical trial provides the first indication, to our knowledge, that normothermic machine perfusion preservation of deceased donor livers reduces both posttransplant EAD and IBC. Use of the OCS Liver also resulted in increased use of livers from donors after cardiac death. Together these findings indicate that OCS Liver preservation is associated with superior posttransplant outcomes and increased donor liver use.ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT02522871},

NMP is frequently performed by using human blood products including red blood cells (RBCs) and fresh frozen plasma (FFP). Our aim was to examine the efficacy of a novel machine perfusion solution based on polymerized bovine hemoglobin‐based oxygen carrier (HBOC)‐201. Twenty‐four livers declined for transplantation were transported by using static cold storage. Upon arrival, livers underwent NMP for 6 hours using pressure‐controlled portal and arterial perfusion. A total of 12 livers were perfused using a solution based on RBCs and FFPs (historical cohort), 6 livers with HBOC‐201 and FFPs, and another 6 livers with HBOC‐201 and gelofusine, a gelatin‐based colloid solution. Compared with RBC + FFP perfused livers, livers perfused with HBOC‐201 had significantly higher hepatic adenosine triphosphate content, cumulative bile production, and portal and arterial flows. Biliary secretion of bicarbonate, bilirubin, bile salts, and phospholipids was similar in all 3 groups. The alanine aminotransferase concentration in perfusate was lower in the HBOC‐201–perfused groups. In conclusion, NMP of human donor livers can be performed effectively using HBOC‐201 and gelofusine, eliminating the need for human blood products. Perfusing livers with HBOC‐201 is at least similar to perfusion with RBCs and FFP. Some of the biomarkers of liver function and injury even suggest a possible superiority of an HBOC‐201–based perfusion solution and opens a perspective for further optimization of machine perfusion techniques.

  abstract = {Normothermic machine perfusion (NMP) enables viability assessment of donor livers prior to transplantation. NMP is frequently performed by using human blood products including red blood cells (RBCs) and fresh frozen plasma (FFP). Our aim was to examine the efficacy of a novel machine perfusion solution based on polymerized bovine hemoglobin‐based oxygen carrier (HBOC)‐201. Twenty‐four livers declined for transplantation were transported by using static cold storage. Upon arrival, livers underwent NMP for 6 hours using pressure‐controlled portal and arterial perfusion. A total of 12 livers were perfused using a solution based on RBCs and FFPs (historical cohort), 6 livers with HBOC‐201 and FFPs, and another 6 livers with HBOC‐201 and gelofusine, a gelatin‐based colloid solution. Compared with RBC + FFP perfused livers, livers perfused with HBOC‐201 had significantly higher hepatic adenosine triphosphate content, cumulative bile production, and portal and arterial flows. Biliary secretion of bicarbonate, bilirubin, bile salts, and phospholipids was similar in all 3 groups. The alanine aminotransferase concentration in perfusate was lower in the HBOC‐201–perfused groups.

However concerns among clinicians exist about the efficacy of transfusion of washed cell salvage.           Methods:~           We performed a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials in which patients, scheduled for all types of surgery, were randomized to washed cell salvage or to a control group with no cell salvage. Data were independently extracted, risk ratio (RR), and weighted mean differences (WMD) with 95\% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated. Data were pooled using a random effects model. The primary endpoint was the number of patients exposed to allogeneic red blood cell (RBC) transfusion.           Results:~           Out of 1140 search results, a total of 47 trials were included. Overall, the use of washed cell salvage reduced the rate of exposure to allogeneic RBC transfusion by a relative 39\% (RR = 0.61; 95\% CI 0.57 to 0.65; P {$<$} 0.001), resulting in an average saving of 0.20 units of allogeneic RBC per patient (weighted mean differences [WMD] = −0.20; 95\% CI −0.22 to −0.18; P {$<$} 0.001), reduced risk of infection by 28\% (RR = 0.72; 95\% CI 0.54 to 0.97; P = 0.03), reduced length of hospital stay by 2.31 days (WMD = −2.31; 95\% CI −2.50 to −2.11; P {$<$} 0.001), but did not significantly affect risk of mortality (RR = 0.92; 95\% CI 0.63 to 1.34; P = 0.66). No statistical difference could be observed in the number of patients exposed to re-operation, plasma, platelets, or rate of myocardial infarction and stroke.

Six circuits of tubing and oxygenators were connected to each pump. Heparinized fresh human blood was circulated for 72 hours in the systems. Blood samples were drawn at defined intervals. Haemolysis was assessed by determination of lactate dehydrogenase (LD) and potassium, and granulocyte activation by quantification of the granulocyte proteins calprotectin, lactoferrin and myeloperoxidase. Complement activation was assessed by measuring C3 activation products (C3b, iC3b and C3c), and the terminal C5b-9 complement complex (TCC). The results indicate more haemolysis and complement activation in the roller pump group, revealed by significantly higher concentrations of LD, potassium, C3 activation products and TCC. Calprotectin, lactoferrin and myeloperoxidase were all significantly increased in both groups, but the rise appeared earlier in the roller pump group. The concentrations of LD and potassium both correlated significantly with C3 activation products, indicating that complement activation may at least partly be responsible for the haemolysis.},

  abstract = {Background.~           The standard preservation solution used during organ procurement and preservation of most organs is the University of Wisconsin (UW) solution. Despite its superiority over other cold storage solutions, the inclusion of hydroxyethyl starch (HES) as one of the components of the UW solution has been both advocated and denied. This study determined whether HES had any effect on red blood cell (RBC) aggregability and correlated aggregation parameters with HES molecular weight.           Methods.~           Human RBC aggregability and deformability were investigated in vitro, at 4°C, with a laserassisted optical rotation cell analyzer. The study of RBC aggregation in a binary HES-HES system gave an indication about the nature of HES-RBCs interactions. Bright field microscopy and atomic force microscopy were used to morphologically characterize the aggregates size and form.           Results.~           High molecular weight HES and UW solution had a potent hyperaggregating effect; low molecular weight HES had a hypoaggregating effect on RBC. RBC aggregates were of large size and their resistance to dissociation by flow-induced shear stress was high.           Conclusion.~           The authors' in vitro experiments conclusively showed that the physiologic function of RBCs to form aggregates is significantly affected in the presence of HES. The use of high molecular weight HES in UW solution accounts for extended and accelerated aggregation of erythrocytes that may result in stasis of blood and incomplete washout of donor organs before transplantation.},

Summary Given the increasing graft shortage, the transplant community is forced to use so called marginal liver grafts with a higher susceptibility to ischemia-reperfusion injury. This exposes the recipient to a higher risk of graft failure and post-transplant complications. While static cold storage remains the gold standard in low-risk transplant scenarios, dynamic preservation strategies may allow to improve outcomes after transplantation of marginal liver grafts. Two dynamic preservation strategies, end-ischemic hypothermic oxygenated perfusion (HOPE) and continuous normothermic machine perfusion (cNMP), have been evaluated in randomized clinical trials. The results show improved preservation of liver grafts after NMP and reduction of post-transplant biliary complications after HOPE. In comparison to NMP, HOPE has the advantage of requiring less logistics and expertise with the possibility to return to default static cold storage. Both strategies allow to assess graft viability prior to transplantation and may thus contribute to optimizing graft selection and reducing discard rates. The use of dynamic preservation is rapidly increasing in France and results from a national randomized trial on the use of HOPE in extended criteria graft will soon be available. Future applications should focus on controlled donation after circulatory death liver grafts, split grafts and graft treatment during perfusion. The final aim of dynamic liver graft preservation is to improve post-transplant outcomes, increase the number of transplanted grafts and allow expansion of transplant indications.},

  abstract = {Liver transplantation is a highly successful treatment, but is severely limited by the shortage in donor organs. However, many potential donor organs cannot be used; this is because sub-optimal livers do not tolerate conventional cold storage and there is no reliable way to assess organ viability preoperatively. Normothermic machine perfusion maintains the liver in a physiological state, avoids cooling and allows recovery and functional testing. Here we show that, in a randomized trial with 220 liver transplantations, compared to conventional static cold storage, normothermic preservation is associated with a 50\% lower level of graft injury, measured by hepatocellular enzyme release, despite a 50\% lower rate of organ discard and a 54\% longer mean preservation time. There was no significant difference in bile duct complications, graft survival or survival of the patient. If translated to clinical practice, these results would have a major impact on liver transplant outcomes and waiting list mortality.},

  abstract = {Hemolysis is one of the important performance parameters of blood pumps. However, comparisons of published data are compromised by the different test methods used. This article reports the results obtained when testing four non-pulsatile blood pumps (Roller pump, Biopump Model 600, Biopump BP-80, Hemadyne pump) in the identical test circuit under the same hemodynamic conditions. A closed test circuit was composed of a flexible bag reservoir and two short tubes for connection to the pump head. The priming volume was 1 L, and the total surface area was 950 cm2. Fresh blood from a fasted calf was directly primed into the circuit and maintained at 37° C. It was pumped at 6 L/min for 12 hr against a 100 mmHg afterload. The hemolysis index (HI), defined as grams of hemoglobin released per 100 L pumped, was calculated from a curve fit to the hourly data. Each pump was tested five times. The mean HI obtained ranged from 0.0467 for the roller pump to 0.0076 for the Biopump BP-80. There was no statistically significant difference among the three centrifugal pumps tested.},

We present the first patients transplanted using a normothermic machine perfusion (NMP) device that transports and stores an organ in a fully functioning state at 37°C. In this Phase 1 trial, organs were retrieved using standard techniques, attached to the perfusion device at the donor hospital, and transported to the implanting center in a functioning state. NMP livers were matched 1:2 to cold-stored livers. Twenty patients underwent liver transplantation after NMP. Median NMP time was 9.3 (3.5-18.5) h versus median cold ischaemia time of 8.9 (4.2-11.4) h. Thirty-day graft survival was similar (100\% NMP vs. 97.5\% control, p = 1.00). Median peak aspartate aminotransferase in the first 7 days was significantly lower in the NMP group (417 IU [84-4681]) versus (902 IU [218-8786], p = 0.03). This first report of liver transplantation using NMP-preserved livers demonstrates the safety and feasibility of using this technology from retrieval to transplantation, including transportation. NMP may be valuable in increasing the number of donor livers and improving the function of transplantable organs.},

Five identical closed-loop circuits were assembled and primed with saline. The pumps were then calibrated and occlusions were set. In three circuits, the occlusion for the RP was opened at 5 RPMs to support 150, 225, or 300 mmHg (+/-10 mmHg) against a clamped line. In one circuit, a RP was adjusted to a barely non-occlusive setting (1 cm drop/30 inch gradient). The fifth circuit employed a CP. Prior to testing, the saline in each circuit was replaced with one liter of fresh bovine blood (Hct = 22 +/- 2\%). The IH for each treatment was compared in six trials yielding a statistical power {$>$} 0.80. Analysis of variance with multiple comparison (p {$<$} or = 0.05) demonstrated that compared to the barely non-occlusive setting, the IH in the centrifugal pump was not significantly greater. Under-occluded RP settings yielded IHs significantly less than the CP. It appears that opening the occlusion on a roller pump allows a lower IH compared to traditional RP occlusion setting or centrifugal pumping.},

  abstract = {The recent clinical application of perfusion technology for the machine preservation of donation after cardiac death (DCD) grafts has some advantages. Oxygenation has been proposed for the preservation of DCD liver grafts. The aim of this study is to clarify whether the use of HbV-containing preservation solution during the subnormothermic machine perfusion (SNMP) of the liver graft improves the graft function of DCD porcine livers in an ex vivo reperfusion model. Pig livers were excised after 60 minutes of warm ischemic time and were preserved under one of three preservation conditions for 4 hours. The preservation conditions were as follows: 4°C cold storage (CS group; N = 5), Hypothermic machine preservation (HMP) with UW gluconate solution (HMP group; N = 5), SNMP (21°C) with UW gluconate solution (SNMP group; N = 5), SNMP (21°C) with HbVs (Hb; 1.8 mg/dl) perfusate (SNMP+HbV group; N = 5). Autologous blood perfusion was performed for 2 hours in an isolated liver reperfusion model (IRM). The oxygen consumption of the SNMP and SNMP+HbV group was higher than the HMP groups (p {$<$} 0.05). During the reperfusion, the AST level in the SNMP+HbV group was lower than that in the CS, HMP and SNMP groups. The changes in pH after reperfusion was significantly lower in SNMP+HbV group than CS and HMP groups. The ultrastructural findings indicated that the mitochondria of the SNMP+HbV group was well maintained in comparison to the CS, HMP and SNMP groups. The SNMP+HbVs preservation solution protected against metabolic acidosis and preserved the liver function after reperfusion injury in the DCD liver.},

  abstract = {Introduction Ex~vivo normothermic perfusion offers an alternative method of organ preservation, allowing donor kidneys to be reanimated and evaluated prior to transplantation. Beyond preservation, it can be used to characterize the immunological contribution of the donor kidney in isolation. Furthermore, it has the potential to be used as an immunomodulatory strategy to manipulate donor kidneys prior to transplantation. Methods Explanted porcine kidneys underwent 6 hours of perfusion. Sequential perfusate samples were collected and leukocytes characterized via flow cytometry. An inflammatory profile was generated via cytokine quantification. Cell-free DNA was also determined as markers of cell death. Results All kidneys functioned within normal parameters and met the criteria for transplantation at the end of perfusion. Throughout perfusion there were continuous increases in pro-inflammatory cytokines, including large concentrations of interferon-γ, suggesting that perfusion drives a significant inflammatory response. Increasing concentrations in cell-free DNA were also observed, suggesting cell death. During perfusion there was a marked cellular diapedesis of T cells, B cells, natural killer (NK) cells, and monocytes from the kidney into the circuit. Minor populations of granulocytes and macrophages were also detected. Discussion We demonstrate that ex~vivo normothermic perfusion initiates an inflammatory cytokine storm and release of mitochondrial and genomic DNA. This is likely to be responsible for immune cell activation and mobilization into the circuit prior to transplantation. Interestingly this did not have an impact on renal function. These data therefore suggest that normothermic perfusion can be used to immunodeplete and to saturate the pro-inflammatory capacity of donor kidneys prior to transplantation.},

  abstract = {Introduction: Intravascular hemolysis is a significant complication of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO), associated with adverse outcomes such as kidney failure and increased mortality. There is wide variability in the cited incidence of this complication. This survey study aimed to characterize the variability in hemolysis monitoring practices across ECMO centers. Methods: The survey, distributed via the Extracorporeal Life Support Organization (ELSO) newsletter, received 26 responses from various healthcare professionals, including nurses, perfusionists, respiratory therapists, and physicians. Respondents represented both pediatric and adult ECMO units, primarily from academic centers in the USA (46\%). Results: Findings revealed that 92\% of these centers use centrifugal pumps, with heparin and bivalirudin being the preferred anticoagulants. While 68\% of respondents reported having a standard protocol for hemolysis monitoring, the specific protocols varied widely. Plasma-free hemoglobin was the most commonly monitored laboratory test. Definitions for what were considered significant hemolysis varied as well and were primarily identified by red urine and elevated plasma hemoglobin levels. Interventions to address hemolysis included adjusting pump speed, repositioning cannulas, replacing pump heads or oxygenators, and performing plasmapheresis. Conclusion: The study highlights the variability in hemolysis monitoring practices among ECMO centers. Further research is warranted to establish optimal monitoring protocols to detect and potentially treat the complication of hemolysis. Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) is a life support technique used for patients with severe heart or lung problems. One serious complication of ECMO is intravascular hemolysis, where red blood cells break down inside blood vessels. This can lead to kidney damage and even death. However, how often this happens and how it is monitored varies widely across hospitals. To better understand current practices, researchers conducted a survey through the Extracorporeal Life Support Organization (ELSO). They received 26 responses from healthcare professionals working in both adult and pediatric ECMO units, mostly in US academic hospitals. The survey found that while many centers (68\%) have a protocol for monitoring hemolysis, the details of these protocols differ. The most common test used is plasma-free hemoglobin. Signs of hemolysis include red-colored urine and high levels of plasma hemoglobin. When hemolysis is detected, centers may respond by adjusting equipment settings, repositioning tubes, replacing parts, or using treatments like plasmapheresis. This study shows that there is no standard approach to monitoring hemolysis in ECMO patients. More research is needed to develop consistent guidelines that can help detect and treat this complication effectively.},

  abstract = {Key Points~                          The incidence of AKI while undergoing ECMO in pediatric patients is high and independently increases mortality.               Laboratory markers consistent with intravascular hemolysis increase the hazard of a composite outcome of AKI or RRT while undergoing ECMO.               Further research into appropriate monitoring or treatment of ECMO-associated hemolysis may lead to important interventions to prevent AKI.                                   Background~           AKI is common in patients requiring extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO), with a variety of proposed mechanisms. We sought to describe the effect of laboratory evidence of ECMO-associated intravascular hemolysis on AKI and RRT.           Methods~           This retrospective cohort study included patients treated with ECMO at a single center over 10 years. The primary outcome was a composite of time to RRT or AKI (by creatinine-based Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes criteria) after ECMO start. Serum creatinine closest to ECMO start time was considered the pre-ECMO baseline and used to determine abnormal kidney function at ECMO start. The patient's subsequent creatinine values were used to identify AKI on ECMO. Multivariable cause-specific Cox proportional hazards models were used to assess the effect of separate markers of intravascular hemolysis on the time to the composite outcome after controlling for confounders.           Results~           Five hundred and one children were evaluated with a median age 1.2 years, 56\% male. Four separate multivariable models, each with a different marker of hemolysis (plasma-free hemoglobin, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), minimum platelet count, and minimum daily hemoglobin), were used to examine the effect on the composite outcome of AKI/RRT. An elevated plasma-free hemoglobin, the most specific of these hemolysis markers, demonstrated an almost three-fold higher adjusted hazard for the composite outcome (hazard ratio [HR], 2.9; P value {$<$} 0.01; 95\% confidence interval [CI], 1.4 to 5.6). Elevated LDH was associated with an adjusted HR of 3.1 (P value {$<$} 0.01; 95\% CI, 1.7 to 5.5). Effect estimates were also pronounced in a composite outcome of only more severe AKI, stage 2+ AKI/RRT: HR 6.6 (P value {$<$} 0.01; 95\% CI, 3.3 to 13.2) for plasma-free hemoglobin and 2.8 (P value {$<$} 0.01; 95\% CI, 1.5 to 5.6) for LDH.           Conclusions~           Laboratory findings consistent with intravascular hemolysis on ECMO were independently associated with a higher hazard of a composite outcome of AKI/RRT in children undergoing ECMO.

Flows of 300 ml/min (1/4-inch inner-diameter tubing in the roller pump) and 1775 ml/min (1/2-inch inner-diameter tubing in the roller pump) and pressure differences across the pump (delta P = outlet pressure--inlet pressure) of 215 mm Hg (n = 6) and 345 mm Hg (n = 5) were examined.

  abstract = {Background Severe primary graft dysfunction (PGD) of grade 3 (PGD3) is a common serious complication following lung transplantation. We aimed to assess physiological donor lung preservation using the Organ Care System (OCS) Lung device compared with cold static storage. Methods In this non-inferiority, randomised, controlled, open-label, phase 3 trial (INSPIRE) recipients were aged 18 years or older and were registered as standard criteria primary double lung transplant candidates. Eligible donors were younger than 65 years old with a ratio of partial pressure of oxygen in arterial blood to the fraction of inspired oxygen of more than 300 mm\hphantom{,}Hg. Transplant recipients were randomly assigned (1:1) with permuted blocks, stratified by centre, to receive standard criteria donor lungs preserved in the OCS Lung device (OCS arm) or cold storage at 4°C (control arm). The composite primary effectiveness endpoint was absence of PGD3 within the first 72 h after transplant and 30-day survival in the per-protocol population, with a stringent 4\% non-inferiority margin. Superiority was tested upon meeting non-inferiority. The primary safety endpoint was the mean number of lung graft-related serious adverse events within 30 days of transplant. We did analyses in the per-protocol and intention-to-treat populations. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01630434. Findings Between Nov 17, 2011, and Nov 24, 2014, we randomly assigned 370 patients, and 320 (86\%) underwent transplantation (n=151 OCS and n=169 control); follow-up was completed in Nov 24, 2016. The primary endpoint was met in 112 (79·4\%) of 141 patients (95\% CI 71·8 to 85·8) in the OCS group compared with 116 (70·3\%) of 165 patients (62·7 to 77·2) in the control group (non-inferiority point estimate −9·1\%; 95\% CI −∞ to −1·0; p=0·0038; and superiority test p=0·068). Patient survival at day 30 post-transplant was 135 (95·7\%) of 141 patients (95\% CI 91·0–98·4) in the OCS group and 165 patients (100\%; 97·8–100·0) in the control group (p=0·0090) and at 12 months was 126 (89·4\%) of 141 patients (83·1–93·9) for the OCS group compared with 146 (88·1\%) of 165 patients (81·8–92·8) for the control group. Incidence of PGD3 within 72 h was reported in 25 (17·7\%) of 141 patients in the OCS group (95\% CI 11·8 to 25·1) and 49 (29·7\%) of 165 patients in the control group (22·8 to 37·3; superiority test p=0·015). The primary safety endpoint was met (0·23 lung graft-related serious adverse events in the OCS group compared with 0·28 events in the control group [point estimate −0·045\%; 95\% CI −∞ to 0·047; non-inferiority test p=0·020]). In the intention-to-treat population, causes of death at 30 days and in hospital were lung graft failure or lung infection (n=2 for OCS vs n=7 for control), cardiac causes (n=4 vs n=1), vascular or stroke (n=3 vs n=0), metabolic coma (n=0 vs n=2), and generalised sepsis (n=0 vs n=1). Interpretation The INSPIRE trial met its primary effectiveness and safety endpoints. Although no short-term survival benefit was reported, further research is needed to see whether the reduced incidence of PGD3 within 72 h of a transplant might translate into earlier recovery and improved long-term outcomes after lung transplantation.

  abstract = {Persistent shortage and heterogeneous quality of liver grafts encourages the optimization of donor-recipient matching in liver transplantation (LT). We explored whether or not there was a survival benefit (SB) of LT according to the quality of grafts assessed by the Donor Quality Index (DQI) and recipients’ disease severity, using the Model for End-Stage Liver Disease (MELD) in 8387 French patients wait-listed between 2009 and 2014. SB associated with LT was estimated using the sequential stratification method in different categories of MELD and DQI. For each transplantation, a stratum was created that matched one transplanted patient with all eligible control candidates. Strata were thereafter combined, and a stratified Cox model, adjusted for covariates, was fitted in order to estimate hazard ratios that qualified the SB according to each MELD and DQI sub-group. A significant SB was observed for all MELD and DQI sub-groups, with the exception of high MELD patients transplanted with “high-risk” grafts. More specifically, in decompensated-cirrhosis patients, “high-risk” grafts did not appear to be detrimental in medium MELD patients. Interestingly, in hepatocellular-carcinoma (HCC) patients, a significant SB was found for all MELD-DQI combinations. For MELD exceptions no SB was found. In terms of SB, “low-risk” grafts appeared appropriate for most severe patients (MELD\,{$>$}\,30). Conversely, low/medium MELD and HCC patients presented an SB while allocated “high-risk” grafts. Thus, SB based matching rules for LT candidates might improve the survival of the LT population as a whole.},
